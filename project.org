: - [X] add month and year to x-axis labeling
: - [X] move weighted ILI (%) to outside of y-axis and maybe link to description of what it is.
: - [ ] add hover info about what weighted ILI is
: - [X] random jumps of peak week and onset week point estimates (sometimes outside of intervals)
: - [ ] add hover text just on value of points based on snapped-to x coordinate
: - [ ] change boxes for point estimates of week metric to circles with different hover stats
: - [X] add annotation for baseline: "CDC baseline value"
: - [ ] add historical lines with highlight on hover
: - [ ] add color legend/scale for map and switch to different color scheme
: - [ ] little images not showing up on mac
: - [ ] remove predictions that are not showing anything.
: - [ ] add note when there are no predictions to show.
: - [ ] add mouse click as action to move "current time"
: - [ ] add demo slides to introduce key features
: - [ ] clickability of regions
: - [ ] on hover and selection highlights of regions  
: - [X] change text of title to "Real-time Influenza Forecasts: CDC FluSight Challenge"
